# Why does anyoe require a programming language?

* simple: a human, for now, must give instructions to a computer using 
a programming language

### how does this happen?
* human writes instructions using programming language
* instructions are converted to machine code ot/then to binary
* computer executes binary
* instructions followed; job done

### how does a computer execute a binary file
* control units and arithmetic & logic units
* cu looks at a set of instructions and compares them to those stored in
memory; it performs a pre-set task when it finds an instruction that
matches
* alu performs arithmetic and logic
* both cu and alu are made of logic gates
*
